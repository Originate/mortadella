# Delicious Mock Ruby Tables

_A library to create mock tables for Cucumber_

Mortadella makes it easy to programmatically build data tables
that can be compared to Cucumber tables
through `cucumber_table.diff! mortadella_table`.

You want to do this as much as possible,
because Cucumber has very powerful built-in facilities
to display where and how your actual data is different from the expected data.


## Installation

* add `gem 'mortadella'` to your `Gemfile`
* run `bundle`


## Usage

* [basic usage](https://github.com/Originate/mortadella/blob/master/features/mortadella.feature)
* you can also [dry up repetitive fields]() for better readability
       This leads to more readable tables.
